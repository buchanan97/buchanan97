# Hi there, I'm James Buchanan 👋

### Cloud Security & IAM Engineer 🛡️
I am a results-driven **Cloud Security and Identity & Access Management (IAM) Engineer** specializing in authentication security, identity lifecycle automation, and privileged access management. My focus is on building secure, scalable identity architectures that strengthen enterprise defenses and streamline access governance across hybrid and cloud environments.

---

### 💻 What I Do
I solve complex identity challenges to reduce operational friction and improve security posture. My work typically involves:

* **Identity Governance (IGA):** Automating provisioning workflows and lifecycle management using **SailPoint IIQ**.
* **Cloud Security:** Designing **Entra ID (Azure AD)** Conditional Access policies, MFA enforcement, and secure authentication baselines.
* **Privileged Access (PAM):** Integrating and managing privileged access controls with **CyberArk**.
* **Security Automation:** Building **Python** and **PowerShell** scripts for API automation, log parsing, and identity lifecycle tasks.
* **Threat Visibility:** Developing **SIEM-ready log pipelines** (Azure AD → Splunk) to improve monitoring and incident response.
